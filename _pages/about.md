I’m a machine learning researcher working on neural sequence models at the University of Tokyo. Before joining, I worked at [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en). My earlier work includes tensor decomposition and Bayesian inference, but my current focus is recurrent/iterative models, memory-augmented architectures (e.g., Transformers and SSMs), and long-horizon generalization.
